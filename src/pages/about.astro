        <p>
            Hello! I'm Edgar Reyes-Rivera, a dual-major in Computer Engineering
            and Computer Science at Miami University, expecting to graduate in May 2027.
        </p>
        <p>
            My passion lies in solving complex problems that bridge the gap
            between hardware and software. I enjoy diving deep into low-level
            system architecture, with hands-on experience designing a 32-bit TinyRV1
            RISC-V processor in Verilog and engineering FPGA-based image processing filters.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also apply these problem-solving skills to high-level software
            development. As a former Software Engineer Intern at Synchrony,
            I contributed to an agile team developing B2B software for loan
            processing and private label credit cards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of my technical work, I am passionate about leadership
            and advocacy. I currently serve as the President of Miami's
            chapter of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE).
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not programming or leading, you can find me cooking
            or exploring new technical challenges.
        </p>
